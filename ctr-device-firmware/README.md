## Where are the non-FRC firmware files?
The only device with a dedicated non-FRC firmware file is the PCM.
All other devices have universal firmware.  Motor controllers use a special FRC-lock when used with FRC to prevent unauthorized enable.

See the documentation below for Motor Controller use outside of FRC:
